# Bank-System
Bank Management System built using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Developed as a practical application of Course 11 (OOP Applications).

# 🏦 Bank System Project (OOP Application)

## 📌 Overview
A comprehensive console-based **Bank Management System** developed using **C++** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This project simulates a real-world banking environment where users can manage clients, perform transactions, and manage system users with different permissions.

This project is a practical application of the **"OOP Applications"** course, focusing on clean code, modular design, and file handling.

## 🚀 Features
The system includes a variety of functional screens and menus:

### 1. 👤 Client Management
- **Add New Client:** Create new bank accounts with unique account numbers.
- **Show All Clients:** Display a formatted list of all clients.
- **Find Client:** Search for a client by account number.
- **Update Client:** Modify client details (Name, Phone, PinCode, Balance).
- **Delete Client:** Remove a client from the system permanently.

### 2. 💸 Transactions & Currency
- **Deposit & Withdraw:** Perform secure transactions.
- **Total Balances:** View total balances of all clients.
- **Transfer:** Transfer money between accounts securely.
- **Transfer Log:** View a history of all transfers.
- **Currency Exchange:**  Convert currencies and view exchange rates.

### 3. 🔐 User Management & Security
- **Login/Logout System:** Secure login requiring Username and Password.
- **Manage Users:** Add, List, Delete, and Update system users.
- **Permissions:** Assign specific access rights to different users (e.g., a user can only view clients but cannot delete them).
- **Login Register:** Tracks all login attempts (Success/Fail) with timestamps.

## 🛠️ Technical Concepts Used
This project demonstrates proficiency in the following C++ concepts:
- **OOP Principles:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
- **File Handling:** Storing and retrieving data (Clients, Users, Logs) using text files.
- **Data Structures:** Using Vectors and Structures for efficient data management.
- **Modular Design:** Separating logic into different classes (e.g., `clsBankClient`, `clsUser`, `clsScreen`) and header files.
- **Input Validation:** Ensuring robust user input handling.
- **String Manipulation:** Custom string library for formatting and parsing data.
